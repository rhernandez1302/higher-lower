# higher-lower
Game where user chooses who has more followers.
Part of 100 days of code. This is my solution to day 14 challenge where I was tasked to make this game. This is before I see the solution provided. 
Had a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to work with dictonaries and being able to pull data from it.
Gave me experince having to look stuff up and figure out how I was able to compare values in dictornaries. 
Maybe should have used more functions in my code.
